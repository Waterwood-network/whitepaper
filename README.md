# Waterwood Crypto - Interactive Whitepaper

## Introduction

We've decided to take a different approach with our whitepaper. Here you can read our vision of Waterwood Crypto with easy to use navigation.

Waterwood is a fork on BSC of ethereum project Datamine. Audit links have been preserved to the original project to keep the line of trust. 

You can also see Datamine [DAM](contracts/dam.sol) and [FLUX](contracts/flux.sol) contracts along with [WATER](contracts/WATER.sol) and [WOOD](contracts/WOOD.sol) contracts in the [contracts folder](contracts/)

Be sure to check the whitepaper for frequent updates as there is a lot to discuss.
